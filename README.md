 **Assignments Q/A:**

   **How can you implement shared functionality across a component tree?**
   - Context API: Use Reactâ€™s Context API to create a context and provide it at a high level in the component tree
   - Render Props: Use render props to pass shared functionality to child components.

   **Why is the useState hook appropriate for handling state in a complex component?**
   - The useState hook is appropriate for handling state in a complex component because it allows you to manage local state easily and efficiently. It provides a simple API to initialize state and update it as needed. With useState, you can handle multiple state variables, making it flexible for complex logic. Additionally, it ensures that state updates trigger re-renders, keeping the UI in sync with the state. Its integration with functional components also promotes cleaner and more maintainable code.
